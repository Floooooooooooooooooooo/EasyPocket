## 🚀 Quick Start Paths

### Path 1: I have a 3D printer
1. Read: CAD_GUIDE.md → Create 3D model
2. Reference: TECHNICAL_SPECS.md → Get dimensions
3. Read: MATERIALS.md → Buy TPU filament
4. Print using settings from TECHNICAL_SPECS.md
5. Test using TESTING_GUIDE.md

**Time:** 1-2 days | **Cost:** $3-5

### Path 2: I want to hand-build it
1. Read: PROTOTYPE_V1.md → Understand design
2. Reference: TECHNICAL_SPECS.md → Get flat pattern
3. Read: MATERIALS.md → Buy fabric/leather
4. Build using assembly instructions
5. Test using TESTING_GUIDE.md

**Time:** 2-3 hours | **Cost:** $7-13

### Path 3: I want to use a print service
1. Read: CAD_GUIDE.md → Create 3D model OR find someone to do it
2. Export STL file
3. Upload to service (see MATERIALS.md for options)
4. Order with TPU material
5. Test when received using TESTING_GUIDE.md

**Time:** 1-2 weeks | **Cost:** $20-40

## ✅ Prototype Checklist

### Planning Phase
- [ ] Read all documentation
- [ ] Choose construction method
- [ ] Order materials from MATERIALS.md
- [ ] Gather required tools

### Build Phase
- [ ] Create/obtain 3D model (if printing)
- [ ] Produce prototype
- [ ] Apply adhesive backing
- [ ] Initial quality inspection

### Testing Phase
- [ ] Phase 1: Visual inspection
- [ ] Phase 2: Functional tests (cards, cash, attachment)
- [ ] Phase 3: Durability tests (drops, wear)
- [ ] Phase 4: User experience tests
- [ ] Phase 5: Environmental tests (optional)

### Iteration Phase
- [ ] Document all issues found
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Plan improvements for V1.1
- [ ] Update documentation

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your prototype is successful if it:
- ✅ Holds 2-4 cards securely
- ✅ Stores folded cash
- ✅ Attaches firmly to phone/case
- ✅ Cards/cash easily accessible
- ✅ Survives 50+ insertion cycles
- ✅ Survives waist-height drops
- ✅ Users rate it ≥3.0/5.0

## 🔧 Required Tools

### For 3D Printing
- 3D printer (TPU-capable)
- Flush cutters
- Sandpaper (fine grit)
- Digital calipers

### For Hand-Building
- Sharp scissors/cutter
- Ruler & marking tool
- Sewing machine or needle
- Adhesive (E6000 or similar)

### For Testing
- Digital calipers
- Scale
- Test cards & cash
- Test phone/mockup
- Camera (for documentation)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Build Method 2 (hand-cut) first to validate concept, then move to 3D printing
2. **Prototype Multiple:** Make 2-3 units to test variations
3. **Document Everything:** Take photos, record measurements, note issues
4. **Get Feedback Early:** Test with real users as soon as you have a functional prototype
5. **Iterate Fast:** Don't aim for perfection in V1, aim for learning

## 📊 Timeline

```
Day 1-2:   Order materials, review documentation
Day 3-4:   Create 3D model OR cut pattern
Day 4-5:   Build prototype(s)
Day 5:     Initial testing (Phases 1-2)
Week 2:    Extended testing (Phases 3-5)
Week 3:    User testing & feedback gathering
Week 4:    Analysis & V1.1 planning
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution | Document |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Cards too tight | Increase slot width by 0.5mm | TECHNICAL_SPECS.md |
| Cards fall out | Decrease slot width or add texture | TECHNICAL_SPECS.md |
| Print fails | Check TPU settings | TECHNICAL_SPECS.md |
| Adhesive weak | Wait 24hrs, try different surface | MATERIALS.md |
| Too bulky | Reduce depth, use thinner walls | PROTOTYPE_V1.md |

## 📞 Next Steps After V1

1. Gather all test data and user feedback
2. Identify top 3 issues to address
3. Design V1.1 with improvements
4. Consider:
   - RFID blocking layer
   - Magnetic closures
   - Multiple color options
   - Different phone sizes
   - Branding/logo placement
