# EasyPocket
A small gadget for mobile phones to have a storage for your cards and some money.

## Project Status
🚧 **Prototype Phase** - First prototype (V1) specifications complete

## Overview
EasyPocket is a compact, phone-attachable accessory designed to store:
- 2-4 credit/debit cards
- Folded cash (up to 10 bills)
- Attaches securely to the back of your phone or phone case

Perfect for minimalists who want to carry less while keeping essentials accessible.

## Prototype V1 Documentation

### Quick Start
1. **[Prototype Specifications](PROTOTYPE_V1.md)** - Complete overview of V1 design goals, features, and construction methods
2. **[Technical Drawings](TECHNICAL_SPECS.md)** - Detailed dimensions, materials, and assembly instructions
3. **[CAD Guide](CAD_GUIDE.md)** - Instructions for creating 3D models
4. **[Materials & Sourcing](MATERIALS.md)** - What to buy and where to get it
5. **[Testing Guide](TESTING_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive testing and validation procedures

### Key Features (V1)
- **Dimensions:** 90mm × 60mm × 8-12mm
- **Weight:** ~25g (loaded)
- **Material:** Flexible TPU or fabric/leather
- **Attachment:** Removable adhesive backing
- **Capacity:** 2-4 cards + folded cash

### Manufacturing Options
1. **3D Printing** (Recommended) - Use TPU filament, 3-4 hour print time
2. **Hand-Built** - Fabric, leather, or foam with sewing/adhesive
3. **3D Print Service** - Send files to online printing service

### Getting Started

#### Option 1: 3D Print at Home
```bash
1. Review CAD_GUIDE.md to create 3D model
2. Export as STL file
3. Slice with appropriate settings (see TECHNICAL_SPECS.md)
4. Print with TPU filament
5. Follow assembly instructions in PROTOTYPE_V1.md
```

#### Option 2: Hand-Build Prototype
```bash
1. Purchase materials from MATERIALS.md
2. Follow pattern specifications in TECHNICAL_SPECS.md
3. Cut and assemble per PROTOTYPE_V1.md instructions
4. Test according to TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

#### Option 3: Order from Service
```bash
1. Create 3D model following CAD_GUIDE.md
2. Export STL file
3. Upload to service (Shapeways, Sculpteo, etc.)
4. Select TPU material
5. Receive and test
```

### Testing Your Prototype
Follow the comprehensive testing procedures in [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md):
- Initial quality inspection
- Functional testing (card/cash storage)
- Durability testing (drops, wear)
- User experience evaluation
- Environmental testing

### Cost Estimate
- **DIY 3D Print:** $3-4 per unit
- **Hand-Built:** $7-13 per unit
- **Print Service:** $20-40 per unit

### Timeline
- Design & modeling: 2-3 days
- Prototype production: 1-2 days
- Testing period: 1 week
- **Total: ~2 weeks for complete V1 cycle**

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete prototype specifications
2. ⏳ Create 3D CAD model (see CAD_GUIDE.md)
3. ⏳ Produce 2-3 physical prototypes
4. ⏳ Conduct user testing
5. ⏳ Iterate to V1.1 based on feedback
