- Weight: ~25g

### Storage Capacity
- Cards: 2-4 standard cards (credit card size: 85.60 × 53.98 mm)
- Cash: Folded bills (up to 10 bills)

### Materials Required

#### Main Body
- Material: Flexible silicone or TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)
- Color: Black (for prototype)
- Thickness: 1.5mm walls
- Durometer: Shore A 60-70 (medium flexibility)

#### Card Slot

- Opening width: 55mm
- Slot depth: 85mm

#### Attachment System
- 3M adhesive strip (removable)
- Dimensions: 50mm x 30mm
- Alternative: Elastic band system for testing

### Key Features

1. **Card Pocket**
   - Vertical orientation
   - Easy-access top opening
   - Friction fit to secure cards
   - Slightly tapered design for easy insertion/removal

2. **Cash Compartment**
   - Separate from card pocket
   - Horizontal opening
   - Fold-over flap closure

3. **Phone Attachment**
   - Adhesive back panel
   - Compatible with phone cases
   - Removable without residue

## Prototype Construction Methods

### Method 1: 3D Printing (Recommended for V1)
- Technology: FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)
- Material: TPU filament (NinjaFlex or similar)
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 20%
- Supports: Minimal, only for overhangs >45°
- Print time: ~3-4 hours

### Method 2: Hand-Cut Prototype
- Materials: Fabric, leather, or craft foam
- Assembly: Stitching or adhesive
- Time: 2-3 hours
- Cost: $5-10

### Method 3: Silicone Molding
- Create mold from clay or 3D printed master
- Pour silicone compound
- Cure time: 24 hours
- More expensive but higher quality

## Assembly Instructions

### For 3D Printed Prototype:
1. Print main body piece
2. Remove supports carefully
3. Clean up any stringing or imperfections
4. Apply adhesive backing to rear panel
5. Test card insertion/removal
6. Verify phone attachment

### For Hand-Cut Prototype:
1. Cut main body panel (90mm x 60mm)
2. Cut and attach card pocket (85mm x 55mm)
3. Cut and attach cash pocket (60mm x 40mm)
4. Sew or glue edges
5. Attach elastic bands or adhesive
6. Reinforce stress points

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Cards slide in and out smoothly
- [ ] Cards stay secure during normal movement
- [ ] Cash can be folded and stored
- [ ] Cash is easily accessible
- [ ] Attaches firmly to phone
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with phone buttons
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with wireless charging (if applicable)

### Durability Tests
- [ ] Pocket integrity after 50 card insertions
- [ ] Adhesive holds after 24 hours
- [ ] Material doesn't degrade with pocket contents
- [ ] Corners don't peel or crack
- [ ] Stitching/joints remain intact

### Usability Tests
- [ ] Can be used one-handed
- [ ] Cards visible enough to identify
- [ ] Doesn't add excessive bulk to phone
- [ ] Comfortable in pocket
- [ ] Aesthetically acceptable

## Prototype Iterations

### Version 1.0 (Current)
- Basic proof of concept
- Single material construction
- Simple adhesive attachment

### Version 1.1 (Planned)
- Refined dimensions based on testing
- Improved card retention
- Better adhesive solution

### Version 1.2 (Planned)
- Add RFID blocking layer (optional)
- Magnetic closure for cash compartment
- Multiple color options

## Safety Considerations
- Ensure no sharp edges
- Verify adhesive is phone-safe
- Test that device doesn't overheat phone
- Confirm cards aren't damaged by material

## Cost Estimate (Prototype V1)
- 3D printing materials: $3-5
- Adhesive: $2-3
- Testing materials: $5
- **Total: $10-13 per unit**

## Next Steps
1. Create 3D CAD model or physical pattern
2. Produce 2-3 prototype units
3. Conduct user testing with 5-10 people
4. Gather feedback
5. Iterate on design
6. Plan for V1.1

## Timeline
- Design completion: 2-3 days
- Prototype production: 1-2 days
- Testing period: 1 week
- Iteration planning: 1-2 days
- **Total: ~2 weeks for V1 cycle**

## Notes
- Keep detailed notes during testing
- Photograph all prototypes
- Record user feedback systematically
- Document any issues or failures
- Track material performance
